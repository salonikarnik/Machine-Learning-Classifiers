The assignment couldn't be compiled into a single R script because each of the classifier had different requirements for which reading the data from the command line wasn't enough. Some classifiers such as neural network needed parameters from the data file to create a subset. Thus, there are now 5 R scripts that can be run from the command line.

These R scripts require input from the command line as given in the assignment problem file. It will require a dataset path,a boolean flag indicating whether the dataset contains a header and the position of the class attribute column, from the command line.

There is an MS-excel report in this folder which has all the accuracies and the best parameters reported in a tabular form.
